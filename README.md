## Steps
1. Search Steganography online and use the first link: https://stylesuxx.github.io/steganography/
2. Google an image and save the file.
3. Navigate to the steganography page and type in a message (This is a secret message. No one should see this message) and click on **Encode**
4. You will see the binary representation of the message.
5. You will also see the image of **Message hidden in the image** option. Right click and save this file as **dog with text**
6. Refresh the steganography website and upload the **dog with text** image. Click on the **Decode** and you will be able to see the message.

Note: Steganography is very complex to stop, data filtering software such as DLP can be used. If you suspect an image has steganography, you need to have the original image to hash this file and the suspected image to verify if the hashes are different.
